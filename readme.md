# Task Management API

This project is a simple Task Management API built with Node.js and Express, and written in TypeScript. The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. It includes input validation using `express-validator` and utilizes in-memory storage for managing tasks.

## Features

- **Create Task**: Add a new task to the task list.
- **Get All Tasks**: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
- **Get Task by ID**: Retrieve a specific task by its ID.
- **Update Task**: Update the details of a specific task.
- **Delete Task**: Delete a specific task by its ID.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that task data is valid before processing.

## Endpoints

- `GET /` - Root endpoint to check if the server is working.
- `GET /get-tasks` - Retrieve all tasks.
- `POST /create-task` - Create a new task.
- `GET /:id` - Retrieve a specific task by ID.
- `PUT /:id` - Update a specific task by ID.
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete a specific task by ID.
